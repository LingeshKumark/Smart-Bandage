# Smart-Bandage
Overview:
  The Smart Bandage Monitoring System is an innovative project that leverages Arduino technology to enhance wound care and monitoring. This system combines various sensors and a microcontroller to provide real-time data on key parameters related to wound healing. The integration of Arduino makes the monitoring process efficient, user-friendly, and accessible for both healthcare professionals and individuals managing their wounds at home.

Key Components:
Arduino Microcontroller: The brain of the system, the Arduino board, processes data from the attached sensors and facilitates real-time monitoring.

Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure Sensors: These sensors (e.g., BME280) provide accurate readings of the wound's environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, and pressure.

Light Sensor (TSL2591): This sensor measures ambient light levels, which can be crucial for wound healing assessment, as some wounds benefit from exposure to natural light.

Moisture Sensor: Monitors the moisture level around the wound, providing insights into the healing environment.

pH Sensor: Measures the pH level of the wound area, as pH can impact the healing process.

Gas Sensor: Detects the presence of specific gases, offering additional information about the wound environment.

Key Features:
Real-Time Monitoring: The Smart Bandage continuously monitors temperature, humidity, pressure, light, moisture, pH, and gas levels in real-time.

Arduino-Based Processing: The Arduino microcontroller processes the sensor data, providing a consolidated view of the wound conditions.

Data Logging: The system logs historical data, allowing healthcare professionals to track changes over time and make informed decisions.

User-Friendly Interface: The collected data is presented through a user-friendly interface, accessible via the Arduino IDE or a dedicated application.Customizable Alerts: The system can be programmed to send alerts for specific conditions, such as abnormal pH levels or insufficient moisture.

How to Use:
Assemble the Hardware: Connect the specified sensors to the Arduino board following the provided wiring instructions.
Upload Arduino Sketch: Use the Arduino IDE to upload the provided sketch to the Arduino board.Monitor in Real-Time: Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE or interface with a dedicated application to view real-time sensor readings and assess the wound conditions.
